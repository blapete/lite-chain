a lightning chain blockchain



* the data field is specifying what the block is storing
* the hash is a unique value generated for the block based on all of the blocks data
* the last hash creates the link between blocks in the blockchain


* in order to properly the hash you need a cyrptographic hashing function
* the key behing the hashing function is that it consistently creates a unqiue value for any different data input. Even if that data field is only one character off what it was before.

-------------
* hashes are one way, meaning it is virtually impossible to figure out the original data
